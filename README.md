# jeedom_labox
Jeedom plugin to interact with LaBox TV by Numericable &amp; SFR

The plugin interacts with the node module "labox-tv" (forked from https://github.com/RemyJeancolas).
Highly inspired by DashButton plugin (credits go to https://github.com/lunarok).

It uses the webservice on "webservice.labox" host (usually 192.168.0.3)
